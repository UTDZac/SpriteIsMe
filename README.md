## How to use
While not in a battle, this extension draws the Walking Pals icon on top of your character, making it seem like *you* are the Pokémon. It will use the first Pokémon in your party, or if you want to pick a Pokémon to use, do so in:
- Tracker Settings > Extensions > Sprite Is Me > Options
